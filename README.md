# Rock, Paper, Scissor Game!

Hello there, visitor! 

Here is the first ever game I have made by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is so much fun!
I had so much fun creating this even if it's the most simple designed game because I have never really imagined myself creating a game with coding :D 

Feel free to check out my other repos, and here is a link to my LinkedIn if you want to check it out: https://www.linkedin.com/in/liandelacruz/

Thank you!
